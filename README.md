# BrowserGame-ItsMyHouse
Milestone Project 1 for University of Chicago's Software Development Bootcamp

## Description
It's My House is a browser based game in which the player completes a series of quests to scare the current residents out of their recently foreclosed house, such that they can continue living there.  The idea is based on the movie Within (2016, director Phil Claydon). The player lives within the walls, and must avoid detection by the residents while carrying out the quests they find in a Description of Paranormal Encounters book.


 ## Playing the Game
 The game is deployed on github pages for anyone interested to play by following this link: https://akullyot.github.io/BrowserGame-ItsMyHouse/gameindex.html


## Future Improvements

There are still things I wish to implement and improve within this game, including:
1. Forcing linear quest progression
2.
